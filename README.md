Overview:
---

A classic PID algoritm is implemented in this project. A PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) is a widely used and easy to implement control algorithm for reducing the output error in a system, in this case a vehicle. The algorithm takes an input value as a reference (the center of the road) and manipulates the actuators of the car to keep it within the desired range.
Each block of the PID is implemented and calibrated using tunning parameters.

Tools and techniques:
---

* Implemented in C++
* Control techniques and parameter tunning

Reflections:
---

A classic algorithm in control theory, a PID provides an easy way to test and implement a controller.
